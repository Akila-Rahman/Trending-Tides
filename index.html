        description: "Shah Rukh Khan's latest release, Jawan, directed by Atlee, has taken the box office by storm. The action-packed thriller, which also stars Nayanthara and Vijay Sethupathi, quickly crossed the ₹1,000 crore mark globally, making it one of the highest-grossing Indian films in history. Its success is attributed to SRK’s dual roles in the film—one as a protagonist and another as an antagonist—and Atlee’s signature style of high-octane drama. Fans have praised the film for its gripping narrative, as well as SRK's transformative performance, marking a high point in his career after Pathaan (2023). This film further solidified SRK’s unparalleled box-office draw, proving his status as the reigning King of Bollywood.",
